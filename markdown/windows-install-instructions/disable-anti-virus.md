If something is blocking the EcoAssist installer exe file due to "virus detected," it means Windows Defender (or another antivirus) is preventing the download. Here’s how you can bypass the block.

---------------------------------

**Option 1: Check Windows Defender’s Quarantine**
1. Open Windows Security (press Win + S and search for "Windows Security").
2. Click Virus & threat protection.
3. Scroll down and click Protection history.
4. Look for the blocked .exe file and choose Allow on device.

---------------------------------

**Option 2: Disable Windows Defender Temporarily (if the above doesn't work)**
1. Open Windows Security > Virus & threat protection.
2. Click Manage settings under "Virus & threat protection settings."
3. Turn off Real-time protection. (Remember to turn it back on after downloading!)
4. Try downloading the file again.

---------------------------------

**Option 3: Use Another Browser**
1. Try using Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge, as some browsers have stricter blocking policies.
