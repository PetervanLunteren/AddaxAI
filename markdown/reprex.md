## Minimal, reproducible example
To help us fix issues quickly, we need to be able to reproduce the problem on our end, preferably with a minimal example. Please follow these steps before to describe the bug so we can investigate:

1. Update AddaxAI
First, make sure you’re running the [latest version](https://addaxdatascience.com/addaxai/#install). The issue may already be fixed.

2. Identify the cause
* Does the issue happen after a specific sequence of button clicks?
* Does it involve a particular folder, image, or dataset?
* Can you minimize the problem? For example, does the error still occur with just one image or video?

3. Run AddaxAI in debug mode
Debug mode prints detailed error messages in a console window, which helps us pinpoint the issue. Instructions for running AddaxAI in debug mode, depending on your operating system, can be found [here](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/blob/main/markdown/debug_mode.md). Once in debug mode, try to recreate the error so that a traceback appears in the console.

4. Send a detailed report
Once you’ve gathered the necessary details, [email us](url) with:

* A minimal reproducible example including required images/videos (the simplest way to trigger the error)
* Error logs from the debug console.
* This will help us quickly diagnose and fix the problem.

Thanks for helping us improve AddaxAI!
