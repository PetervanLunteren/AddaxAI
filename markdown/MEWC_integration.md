## Make inference with MEWC models through AddaxAI GUI
Below is a step-by-step tutorial on how to  deploy a custom trained Mega Efficient Wildlife Classifier model (MEWC) through AddaxAI. It assumes that you have successfully completed the phases [mewc-detect](https://github.com/zaandahl/mewc-detect), [mewc-snip](https://github.com/zaandahl/mewc-snip), and [mewc-train](https://github.com/zaandahl/mewc-train). At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to make inference via AddaxAI's graphical user interface (GUI) and optionally publish your model open-source using AddaxAI's network.

### I - Install AddaxAI
Make sure you have the latest version of AddaxAI. To install or update, follow the steps for your operating system as described here: https://addaxdatascience.com/AddaxAI/#install

### II - Navigate to the root folder
All AddaxAI files are located in one folder, called `AddaxAI_files`. Please be aware that it's hidden, so you might have to adjust your settings before you can see it (find out how to: [macOS](https://www.sonarworks.com/support/sonarworks/360003040160-Troubleshooting/360003204140-FAQ/5005750481554-How-to-show-hidden-files-Mac-and-Windows-), [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_11), [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/232649/how-to-show-or-hide-a-hidden-file)).

        └── 📁.AddaxAI_files
```
</details>

### III - Prepare a new model folder
1. Navigate to `/AddaxAI_files/models/cls`. If you don't see the subfolder `Namibian Desert - Addax Data Science`, you might need to open and close the AddaxAI application in order to create the necessary file structure.
2. Create a folder inside `cls` with a descriptive name for your model. For example: `Arctic fauna`.
3. Copy-paste the `variables.json` from `Namibian Desert - Addax Data Science` to your model folder.
4. Place your model file (`.h5` - make sure to take the 'best.h5' and not the 'last.h5') and classes list (`.yaml`) inside your model folder. Always make sure you have a backup - just in case. If you ever need to update AddaxAI, it will remove the entire folder and you'll have to do this again. 
5. The model file can have a custom filename, but make sure your classes list is called `class_list.yaml`. 
6. After completing this section, the folder structure should look something like this:

```raw
─── 📁 AddaxAI_files
    └── 📁 models
        └── 📁 cls
            |── 📁 Arctic fauna
            |   |── variables.json
            |   |── class_list.yaml
            |   └── model_file.h5
            |── 📁 Namibian Desert - Addax Data Science
            |   └── variables.json
            |── 📁 ...
            └── 📁 ...
```


### IV - Adjust JSON values
1. Open your `variables.json` in any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VSCode, etc.) and replace the existing values. Please note that not all fields are required at this time. If you decide to publish your model open-source, you will need to fill in the remaining fields. More about that later in this tutorial. 
    * `model_fname`  - The filename of your model. Make sure you check if you have the right extension. E.g.: `"model_file.h5"`.
    * `description`  - Leave blank. I.e., `""`.
    * `developer`  - Leave blank. I.e., `""`.
    * `env`  - The virtual environment inside which the model should run. I.e., `"tensorflow"`.
    * `type`  - The type of model inferencing. I.e., `"mewc"`.
    * `download_info`  - Leave blank. I.e., `[["", ""]]`.
    * `citation`  - Leave blank. I.e., `""`.
    * `license`  - Leave blank. I.e., `""`.
    * `total_download_size`  - Leave blank. I.e., `""`.
    * `info_url`  - Leave blank. I.e., `""`.
    * `all_classes`  - Your model's species categories. Fill them in the format `["species 1", "species 2", "species 3", ... ]` with _exactly_ the same class names as in your `class_list.yaml`.  
    * `selected_classes`  - The categories that will show up selected inside the GUI. Fill in the same as you did for `all_classes`. 
    * `var_cls_detec_thresh`  - This is the detection threshold. Only above this detection confidence provided by MegaDetector, the animal will be further classified. Must be in the range 0.01 - 0.99. If unsure, leave unaltered. 
    * `var_cls_detec_thresh_default`  - Match `var_cls_detec_thresh`.
    * `var_cls_class_thresh`  - This is the classification threshold.  Below this classification confidence, the model will label the animal with “unidentified animal”. Must be in the range 0.01 - 0.99. If unsure, leave unaltered. 
    * `var_cls_class_thresh_default`  - Match `var_cls_class_thresh`.
    * `var_smooth_cls_animal`  - This is a feature that is temporarily disabled. Keep as `false`.
    * `min_version`  - The minimum version of AddaxAI that is able to run this model. I.e., `"5.5"`.

2. After adjusting the JSON values, your `variables.json` should look something like this:
```json
{
  "model_fname": "model_file.pt",
  "description": "",
  "developer": "",
  "env": "tensorflow",
  "type": "mewc",
  "download_info": [
    [
      "",
      ""
    ]
  ],
  "citation": "",
  "license": "",
  "total_download_size": "",
  "info_url": "",
  "all_classes": [
    "polar bear",
    "fox",
    "walrus",
    "seal",
    "owl",
    "reindeer"
  ],
  "selected_classes": [
    "polar bear",
    "fox",
    "walrus",
    "seal",
    "owl",
    "reindeer"
  ],
  "var_cls_detec_thresh": "0.40",
  "var_cls_detec_thresh_default": "0.40",
  "var_cls_class_thresh": "0.50",
  "var_cls_class_thresh_default": "0.50",
  "var_smooth_cls_animal": false,
  "min_version": "5.5"
}
```
3. Save `variables.json` and open AddaxAI. Your model should now be deployable and visible in the model dropdown menu.

### V - Host on HuggingFace (optional)
Addax Data Science supports open-source principles, aiming to facilitate the distribution of free conservation technology. As part of this commitment, Addax provides the functionality to publish your model open-source via AddaxAI. You can use this network to share your model with other conservationists. You will retain ownership of the model, receive proper attribution, and can select an appropriate open-source license. Should you desire to do so, please proceed with the steps below.
1. Log in or sign up for the HuggingFace model hosting platform: https://huggingface.co/login
2. Once logged in, choose to add a new model: top left click "New" > "Model".

<img width="596" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 12 42 41" src="https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/assets/85185478/a59d81a2-6ef1-463c-96eb-f6f01c712d8d">

3. Choose a name for your model.
4. Select a license. Please do your own research and select whatever suits you best. If you have no idea where to start - there are two common licenses for open-source models: `mit` and `cc-by-nc-sa-4.0`. They both allow people to freely use, share, and adapt the model when proper attribution is given. `cc-by-nc-sa-4.0` differs from `mit` only in the sense that `cc-by-nc-sa-4.0` restricts commercial use.
5. Make sure the model repository is set to public and click "Create model".

7. Click the button "Add file" > "Upload files".

<img width="1402" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 13 12 45" src="https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/assets/85185478/6307e954-0668-4d6d-9e90-e4fdd3fe47ba">

8. Drag and drop your model file (`.h5`) and classes list (`class_list.yaml`) and click "Commit to changes to `main`".

<img width="1153" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 13 16 00" src="https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/assets/85185478/84585b4d-c4cf-4529-8d44-d5d96c2a86d8">

9. Once uploaded, open your `variables.json` and fill in the remaining fields.

    * `description`  -  Fill in a short description about the model, on how many images it was trained, which purpose it serves, etc.
    * `developer`  - Fill in the organization which has developed the model. 
    * `download_info`  - Provide the links and filenames of the model file and classes list in the format `[["url", "filename"], ["url", "filename"]]`. You can retrieve the download URL by right-clicking the download button and selecting "Copy link address". See below for an example. 
    * `citation`  - If you want users to cite, provide the URL to your paper. Otherwise, leave blank.
    * `license`  - Provide a URL to your license, or leave blank.
    * `total_download_size`  -  Fill in the size of your model file, e.g. "107 MB".
    * `info_url`  -  Provide a URL to a webpage for users to find more information, or leave blank. 
  
10. After adjusting the JSON values, your `variables.json` should look something like this:
```json
{
  "model_fname": "model_file.pt",
  "description": "The model was trained on X images taken from database Y and is meant for Z.",
  "developer": "Addax Data Science",

    "reindeer"
  ],
  "var_cls_detec_thresh": "0.40",
  "var_cls_detec_thresh_default": "0.40",
  "var_cls_class_thresh": "0.50",
  "var_cls_class_thresh_default": "0.50",
  "var_smooth_cls_animal": false,
  "min_version": "5.5"
}
```

### VI - Publish via AddaxAI (optional)
Everything is ready for the model to be published. You can either send your `variables.json` via email to peter@addaxdatascience.com, or create a pull request and add `variables.json` as a `key:value` pair to the `cls` dictionary in the latest `model_info.json` file: https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/tree/main/model_info

You're done! Peter van Lunteren will review the information and take it from here.
