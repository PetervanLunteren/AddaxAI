## New features
- [ ] TIMELAPSE STANDALONE APP
- [ ] DEPTH ESTIMATION
- [ ] PROCESS BATCH RESULTS - https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/blob/main/megadetector/postprocessing/postprocess_batch_results.py
- [ ] BATCH PROCESSING OPTION - a completely separate option to do batch processing, where it just runs det+cls on all data recursively, and is agnostic of its contents (doestn need to know if it is a deployment, site, full project, etc.) It just runs everything at once. Users should be able to set settings before running the analysis. Then, after, it should give the user a few options, like export to CSV, XLSX, maps & graphs, separate into subfolders, etc. The bulk / management choice should be the first page users see when opening AddaxAI. 

TASK: 

add a completely separate option to do batch processing, where it just runs det+cls on all data recursively, and is agnostic of its contents (doestn need to know if it is a deployment, site, full project, etc.) It just runs everything at once. Users should be able to set settings before running the analysis. Then, after, it should give the user a few options, like export to CSV, XLSX, maps & graphs, separate into subfolders, etc. 

IN terms of UX, where and how should this feature live? A separate page where users can navigate to "bulk" or "project based / management feature"? Or something else? I'm envisioning more options later, like projects for fish, projects page for drones, etc. So we need to think ahead of how we want to do this UX UI wise. What is your best guess on how it should go? Try to think like an AddaxAI user. 



- [ ] IN DEPTH PLOT - add new in depth plot: Gantt-style timeline — one horizontal bar per deployment (or per site), showing the active period. Immediately shows gaps, overlaps, and total survey effort. Group by site with one bar per deployment within each site row. do webqueries on how other platforms do this, and what the standard is, and what is usually reported in terms of metrics. Research scientific papers etc. 

## Installer
- [ ] merge all alembic/versions/ into one. We do not have any users yet, so we can make it just the start DB. 
- [ ] make sure on app istall it installs the default models and their environments (MDv5A and DINOv2-B). 

## Nice to haves
- [ ] SUBSAHARA GEOFILE - Add a geolocation file for the Sub Saharan model too, like SpeciesNet, so users of the SSmodel can also prefil by country. 
- [ ] CLS THRESH - add a classification threshold and a per species override. Check how that is one in AddaxAI-Connect. I want something like that.  
- [ ] DINOv3 - would it make sense to upgrade the app to use DINOv3 instead of DINOv2?
- [ ] ROLLDOWN - exlusion rollup currently works like this (corect me if i'm wrong!):
    > raw: wolf 60%, dog 20%, bear 10%, cat 10%.
    > exluded wolf, included dog, cat, bear: dog 20%, bear 10%, cat 10%, wolf 0%. 
    > Detection was wolf top-1, which is excluded, so it check the parent taxon to see if that is included. Canidea is included (via dog), so the deteciton gets the prediction (canidae 80%), am I correct? 
    > What if we also allow rolldown if there is only one child taxon present? The above example would then go to canidae 80% and see that there is only one canidae possible, so it must be that one, so it rollsdown to dog 80%. What do you think? If the raw prediction was wolf 60%, dog 20%, fox 10%, cat 10%, the rolldown wouldn't have worked since then there are two childs of the canidae, and hence the prediciton would remain canidae 80%. Agree? What do yout think of this appraoch? And what would it take to implement it?
