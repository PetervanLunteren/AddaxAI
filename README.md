EcoAssist is an application designed to make life easier for wildlife ecologists who work with cameratrap data. I know how time-consuming it can be to analyse every image. Thanks to the good people at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md">MegaDetector</a>, there is a  model which can recognise animals in camera trap images in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems so that you don't have to wade through all the empty images. The only problem with this model is that you need to know a bit of coding before you can use it. That is where EcoAssist comes in handy. It's a small program which makes it easy for everybody.

###
I've written this application in my free evenings and would really appreciate it if people would let me know when it's used. You can contact me at [contact@pvanlunteren.com](mailto:contact@pvanlunteren.com). Please also help me to keep improving EcoAssist and let me know about any improvements, bugs, or new features so that I can keep it up-to-date.

## Features
* Use the `MDv5` model to tag animals, persons and vehicles in both images and video's
* Filter out empty images, people, vehicles or animals
* Review and edit annotations using [labelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg)
* Export `.xml` label files in Pascal VOC format for further model training
* Manipulate data by drawing boxes or cropping detections

## How to download?
For now, it is only available for OSX users. I'm in the process of also adopting Linux and Windows.

EcoAssist needs the open-source software [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run properly. The steps below will install Anaconda if not already installed on your computer. Please note that when you install EcoAssist it is expected the [license terms of Anaconda](https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en/?name=end-user-license-agreements#ae-5) are agreed upon.

1. Download and open [this file](https://PetervanLunteren.github.io/EcoAssist/MacOS_Linux_install_EcoAssist.command). Mac OS can be quite reluctant when having to open command files downloaded from the internet. You can circumvent trust issues by opening it with right-click > open > open. If that still doesn't work you can change the file permissions by opening a new terminal window and copy-pasting `chmod 755 ~/Downloads/install_EcoAssist.command`. Then try again.
2. Go get yourself a beverage because this might take a few minutes to complete. Especially for M1 users since some of the software packages are not yet adopted to the M1 processor. I have found a workaround, but it takes some time. Please be patient and wait until you see a message saying the process is completed.

## How to start the application?
```
 üìÅApplications
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑEcoAssist.command
```
EcoAssist will open when you double-click the file above. You are free to move this file to a more convenient location. If you want EcoAssist in your dock, manually change `EcoAssist.command` to `EcoAssist.app`, then drag and drop it in your dock and change it back to `EcoAssist.command`. Not the prettiest solution, but it works...

## GPU Support
It is possible to run EcoAssist on your GPU for faster processing (I just never tried it before). See [this page](https://github.com/petargyurov/megadetector-gui/blob/master/GPU_SUPPORT.md) for more information. You would probably be best off by installing EcoAssist normally and afterwards installing the proper software into the `ecoassistcondaenv` conda environment.

## How to uninstall EcoAssist?
You can uninstall EcoAssist by executing [this file](https://PetervanLunteren.github.io/EcoAssist/MacOS_Linux_uninstall_EcoAssist.command). It will prompt you whether you want to uninstall Anaconda too. If you use Anaconda for something else you probably don't want to uninstall it. You can just type `yes` or `no`.
