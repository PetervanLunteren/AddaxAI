# Bypass virus detection

If something is blocking the AddaxAI installer exe file due to "virus detected," or "blocked as unsafe," it means some security software is preventing the download. Here’s how you can bypass the block.

---------------------------------

**Option 1: Use another browser**
1. Some users experience trouble with using Microsoft Edge. Try using a different browser such as Chrome, since some browsers have stricter blocking policies.

---------------------------------

**Option 2: Check Windows defender’s quarantine**
1. Open Windows Security (press Win + S and search for "Windows Security").
2. Click Virus & threat protection.
3. Scroll down and click Protection history.
4. Look for the blocked .exe file and choose Allow on device.

---------------------------------

**Option 3: Disable Windows defender temporarily (if the above doesn't work)**
1. Open Windows Security > Virus & threat protection.
2. Click Manage settings under "Virus & threat protection settings."
3. Turn off Real-time protection. (Remember to turn it back on after downloading!)
4. Try downloading the file again.
