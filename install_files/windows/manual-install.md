# Steps to manually install AddaxAI

Below are instructions for AddaxAI users who are unable to execute the normal install due to unstable internet, security issues, or something else. Installing AddaxAI should be plan B, as the normal installation is much quicker, performs additional checks, and automates the whole process. If you haven't tried the [normal install](https://addaxdatascience.com/AddaxAI-windows/) yet, please try that first. 

**Follow the steps below to install AddaxAI from a ZIP file.**
1. Download both parts of the compressed files:
   - [Part 1 (~1.9 GB)](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/releases/latest/download/windows-base-install.7z.001)
   - [Part 2 (~1.5 GB)](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/releases/latest/download/windows-base-install.7z.002)

   After downloading both files, open a Command Prompt and combine them:
   ```
   copy /b "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows-base-install.7z.001"+"%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows-base-install.7z.002" "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\base-install.7z"
   ```
   If the internet connection is too unstable or slow for this to work, see the 'Download using the command line for a resume option in unstable internet' alternative at the bottom of this page.

<br>
<br>
  
2. Create an `AddaxAI_files` subfolder in your user folder: `C:\Users\<your_username>\AddaxAI_files`

3. Download 7zip via [this link](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2408-x64.exe), double-click the `7z2408-x64.exe` file in your Downloads folder, leave the destination folder as it is, and press 'Install'. After a few seconds, it should be installed, and the window can be closed by clicking 'Close'.

<br>
<br>

4. Navigate to the `base-install.7z` file. It will be in your Downloads folder.
5. Right-click > (Optionally: 'Show more options') > 7-zip > Extract files...

<br>
<br>

6. Click the `...` button to browse your user folder. The location is important. Choose `C:\Users\<your_username>\AddaxAI_files`.
7. Make sure the checkbox under the 'Extract to' path is unchecked.
8. Choose 'Overwrite without prompt' as 'Overwrite mode'. 
9. Click OK. This process will take about 1–5 minutes.

<br>
<br>

10. When the files are extracted, check if AddaxAI works by double-clicking the `C:\Users\<your_username>\AddaxAI_files\AddaxAI\open.bat` file.

<br>
<br>

11. You can create a shortcut file so you don't always have to navigate to the `open.bat` file. If you still have your shortcut file left from the normal install, that will work fine. If not, you can create one by right-clicking on `open.bat` > (Optionally: 'Show more options') > Create shortcut. Then drag and drop that shortcut file to your desktop (or wherever you want to place it) and rename it to 'AddaxAI'.

  <br>

Instead of using the web browser to download the files at step 1, you can also use the command line to download the files to your Downloads folder.

<img width="900" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-26 at 12 12 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef8a286a-ff2f-4a69-8a57-40e4bc4918e2" />

Open up a command prompt window (you might have to search for it via 'Start') and execute the following commands. If the download is interrupted, you can resume the download by executing the same commands again. If both downloads have finished, combine them and continue the install process at step 2 at the top of this page.

  <br>

```
curl --retry 5 --retry-delay 10 --continue-at - -L -o "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows-base-install.7z.001" "https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/releases/latest/download/windows-base-install.7z.001"
curl --retry 5 --retry-delay 10 --continue-at - -L -o "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows-base-install.7z.002" "https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/releases/latest/download/windows-base-install.7z.002"
copy /b "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows-base-install.7z.001"+"%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows-base-install.7z.002" "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\base-install.7z"
```
