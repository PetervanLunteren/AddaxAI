# Help restore the EcoAssist installer
### _Report the false positive to Microsoft_
Lately, the EcoAssist installer has been incorrectly flagged as a trojan horse virus by Microsoft Defender. This false detection prevents users from installing the software unless they disable their antivirus software.

If enough users report this as a false positive, Microsoft will review it and remove the incorrect classification.

Please follow the steps below to help restore the installer:

1. Go to the Microsoft Security Intelligence portal: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
2. Choose "Home customer" and click "Continue"

4. Fill in the following values according to your situation. 
   * **Select the Microsoft security product used to scan the file**: This is your antivirus software, blocking the execution of the file. It is likely to be 'Microsoft Defender Antivirus'.
   * **Company name**: Optionally enter your company or leave blank
   * **Do you have a Microsoft support case number?**: No.
   * **Select the file**: Here you choose the installer "C:\Users<name>\Downloads\windows-installer-latest.exe"
   * **What do you believe this file is?**: Choose 'Incorrectly detected as malware/malicious'
   * **Detection name**: This can be found in your Windows Security history. Open the Windows Security app (Press Win + S, type Windows Security, and open it) > Virus and thread protection > Protection history > Select the installer file > Look for the Detected field. See screenshot below - in my case, it is an Trojan:Win32/Yomal!rfn.
   * **Definition version**: This can also be found in your Windows Security history. Open the Windows Security app > Virus and thread protection > Protection updates > Look for Security Intelligence version. See screenshot below - in my case, it is an 1.421.1803.0.
   * **Additional information**: Describe in your own words why you believe that EcoAssist should not be detected as malware. Something like: "This is the official installer for EcoAssist, an open-source conservation tool for analyzing camera trap images. Microsoft Defender has incorrectly flagged this as a Trojan horse, but it is safe to use. Please review and remove the false positive detection."
