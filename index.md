## About
EcoAssist is an application designed to make life easier for wildlife ecologists who work with cameratrap data. I know how time consuming it can be to analyse every image. Thanks to the good people at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md">MegaDetector</a>, there is a pre-trained model which can recognise animals in camera trap images in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems. The only problem with this model is that you need to know a bit of coding before you can use it. That is where EcoAssist comes in handy. It is a small program which makes it easy for everybody. 

## Features
* Detect animals, persons and vehicles in images or video's
* Separate files into subdirectories based on their detections
* Draw boxes around the detections or crop them
* Create .xml label files in Pascal VOC format for further processing
* Shortcut to labelImg to adjust annotations
* Easily set parameters like threshold and checkpoint frequency

Help me to keep improving EcoAssist and let me know about any improvements, bugs, or new features so that I can continue to keep it up-to-date. Also, I would very much like to know who uses the tool and for what reason. You can contact me at [contact@pvanlunteren.com](mailto:contact@pvanlunteren.com).
